                    <b>I'm well underway with my new project - </b> a Raspberry Pi powered digital picture frame.  The Python
                    side of things is pretty much complete, and you can read about the development process in my new
                    <a href="/piproject-part1">writeup</a>.<br><br>
                    The code's not quite ready for primetime, but it's very nearly there.  I'll keep working on it, but it'll
                    be difficult because my Raspberry Pi is being delivered <em>today</em>.  That means I'm in for a busy
                    couple of days as I try to get the little guy up and running and then try to master Linux at the same time.
                    I'll be sure to post my impressions later in the week.<br><br>

                    <b>I'm back from a healthy week long vacation.</b>  It's been a busy three months since I started learning to program.  My day job keeps a pretty consistently busy
                    pace and then adding as much programming learning as I could find time for on top of that meant that I was more than overdue for some time off.  One of the best strategies I've learned
                    when confronted with a really tricky programming problem is to simply walk away for a while.  This could mean literally walking away (I usually take Bacon on a walk) or just focusing
                    on something else.  The answer is usually much more apparent after you've taken your eyes off of it for a time and returned.<br><br>
                    I decided to take this approach with programming in general.  Nearly every minute of my free time had been soaked up by some technology or another since I started down this path in
                    early March and I was beginning to feel the earliest twinge of burnout, manifesting mainly in a lack of interest in starting another large project.  So I took a week vacation from both
                    work and programming.  It was a glorious week of video games, friends, and relaxation, and I returned from the break refreshed and with ideas for new projects.<br><br>
                    After my last post (nearly three weeks ago) I took a break from projects to just focus on my actual Python knowledge.  I've been maintaining a consistent regimen of daily practice problems
                    and I feel more confident every day, though there is of course still so much to learn.  Now, after my break, I'm ready for another big project and I've decided to start experimenting
                    with the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>!  I'll write up some more details on my specific application of the device this week, which might also serve as a
                    rough outline of the project for myself.  Of course, I'll be documenting the whole process here on my blog.  Right now, though, it's time for research!
