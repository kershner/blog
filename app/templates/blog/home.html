				<h2>New Stuff!</h2>
                <bd>August 25th, 2014</bd>
                <hr>

                    <strong>I spent most of the weekend developing a new app.</strong><br><br>
                    The creatively named <a href="/scrape_reddit">Reddit Image Scraper</a> pulls image links from a specified subreddit,
                    does a bunch of testing and cleanup behind the scenes using Python, and then displays the acceptable links in a nice, readable grid.
                    The idea is that it will make finding and downloading images
                    from reddit a bit easier than manually sifting through a subreddit's front page. It's great for quickly finding
                    wallpapers.  It was fun to make and good for honing my web development skills.<br><br>
                    The project needs a major design pass, as it looks straight out of 2004 or something, but it is fully functional.
                    I'll be sure to make a new post when I finally get around to making it look professional/sexy.
                    <br><br>
                    Feel free to check it out either at the link below or on its project page.

				<h2>AJAX</h2>
                <bd>August 18th, 2014</bd>
                <hr>
				<p>
                    <strong>I've had some breakthroughs in the past few weeks.</strong>  As work continued with my <a href="/gif_party">GIF Party</a>
                    project I came to the realization that a core aspect of my GIF projects was pretty flawed according to both efficiency
                    and UX principles.  The auto page refresh using the <strong>http-equiv="refresh"</strong> designation in the <strong>meta</strong> tags was problematic in a number of ways.
                    First, it's extremely resource intensive to force a hard page reload on a set interval.  Secondly it creates the opportunity for the user to be interrupted
                    before being able to complete their interaction with the menu.  I also wanted to add sliders for the user to be able to modify the images' CSS properties
                    and of course any alterations would be lost upon the next page refresh.<br><br>
                    The solution was to make use of an excellent group of techniques referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a>.<br><br>
                    AJAX stands for <em><strong>Asynchronous Javascript and XML</strong></em>.  It's a way to send and receive data from the server without the need
                    for a client refresh.  Note - technically I'm using <strong>AJAJ</strong>, as the data being transmitted is <a href=http://json.org/">JSON</a> and not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, but the AJAX name persists -
                    it's definitely catchier!
                    This concept allows for much of the dynamic content seen around the web, like new status updates appearing on Facebook without you having to reload the browser.<br><br>
                    AJAX works very well with Flask/Python, especially because of the extremely similar nature of JSON objects and Python dictionaries.  The idea is that you'll have a JavaScript function
                    point to a route in your Flask app.<br>
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">$(document).ready(function() {
    $SCRIPT_ROOT = &#123;&#123; request.script_root|tojson|safe &#125;&#125;;
    $('#5').click(function() {
		$.getJSON($SCRIPT_ROOT + '/gif_party_json_5',
		function(data) {
			getImages();
    });
});
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Above is the new function for selecting '5' as the number of GIFs in GIF Party.  First we include a script-root variable so our web application can find our
                    route/view functions no matter where our app lives.  Check the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/jquery/#where-is-my-site">Flask docs for more info</a>.
                    Secondly we're going to bind a <a href="jquery">jQuery</a> event (<strong>click</strong>) to an HTML element ID (<strong>#5</strong>).  When that ID is clicked, the JavaScript function underneath will fire.
                    This function passes the script root path to the jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/">.getJSON</a> method which will follow that route and retrieve the data associated with it.  The returned data is then
                    passed to my main GIF Party function, <a href="https://github.com/kershner/blog/blob/master/app/static/js/gif-party.js#L139">getImages()</a>.<br><br>
                    Now lets walk through the code on the Flask side.
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">@app.route('/gif_party_json_5')
def gif_party_json_5():
    session['number'] = 5

    data = {
        "number": session['number']
    }

    return jsonify(data)
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Here I store the user's choice of '5' in their <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#sessions">session</a> object and return that
                    value as part of a JSON object.  That object gets passed to the getImages() function and the requested number of GIFs are then updated without the need for
                    a hard page refresh. That's it!<br><br>
                    This new way of doing things has vastly reduced the amount of code in my Flask routes file.  It feels much more logical to have the core application functions
                    be the responsibility of the client and the data that those functions rely on safely stored on the server.  <br><br>
                    Another benefit is the much more efficient
                    use of client resources.  I was able to apply this method to my Raspberry Pi Display and the difference it made was remarkable.  By auto-refreshing the page every
                    20 seconds I was causing a huge amount of strain on the weak Raspberry Pi hardware necessitating a restart of the browser every 10 minutes and a hard reboot of the system
                    every two hours.  Using AJAX, not only do the individual GIFs load faster, but the hardware itself no longer gets bogged down by unnecessary page loads.  The
                    ridiculous little device now hums along uninterrupted all night and day, the only hitches caused by the occasional server congestion of my host.<br><br>
                    Here's to learning new things!

				<h2>Housekeeping</h2>
                <bd>August 4th, 2014</bd>
                <hr>
				<p>
                    <strong>As we roll into a new month</strong> I'm working on a number of different projects simultaneously.
                    Primarily I've been working on CSTools, and have been gradually figuring out databases and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORMs</a>
                    and stuff like that.  I'm going to make a post later in the week walking through my database code,
                    but for now I'm just firing off a quick update to bring attention to my adorable little text
                    adventure.  I finally took some time over the weekend to make a standalone
                    version (no Python required) using <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a>.  You can find a link
                    to the archive on the text adventure's project page, or <a href="/static/distribute/Descent Into Evil.7z">here</a>.
                    Feel free to check out my first attempt at a programming project! FYI - the ending is terrible!<br><br>
                    I also wanted to drop some new photos of my GIF Display somewhere, so they're here as well.  The damn
                    thing still isn't finished yet, but it's at 99.9%.  As always, Kerry and I just need to find the time to paint
                    and style it.  I did some re-engineering on the velcro tabs and the placement of the Pi in order to
                    combat the velcro drooping as the heat from the LCD screen/Pi gradually warm the adhesive, making it
                    less effective.  Everything seems to be in working order now as the GIF Display can comfortably
                    display internet nonsense 24/7.  Anyway, here are some more photos!

				<h2>Picking up Steam</h2>
                <bd>July 30th, 2014</bd>
                <hr>
				<p>
                    <strong>My spare time is almost nonexistant at this point</strong>, but I needed to get another blog post in before
                    July was over!  Things are really ramping up for me programming-wise.  Since the last update I've
                    pretty much completed the GIF Display - it just need some artistic flair as a finishing touch.  We're
                    going to paint the frame (probably gold) and then Kerry is going to decoupage the <em>hell</em> out of the
                    back matting.  That girl can really decoupage!  I'll post new pictures as soon as we find the time
                    to actually do the work.<br><br>
                    In the meantime I've had my plate full with other projects.  I've refined my <a href="/warning">GIF Display Config</a>
                    site with a new interface and better backend code.  This time I've kept an archive of the hilarious first draft,
                    I'll put a link to that on the projects page eventually - it's a real treat.<br><br>
                    I've gotten the chance to start developing a new side project, <a href="/gif-party">GIF Party!</a><br><br>
                    The biggest news is that I'm back to developing my CSTools application, this time at the behest of my
                    bosses in the Customer Service department.  I was asked to design and implement an application to help us keep track
                    of certain loose forms here in the office and I've added it on to the CSTools suite.  I'm really excited about it
                    because it involved setting up a database, and now that I've got one up and running I feel like I've turned
                    another corner in programming and can feel many more doors opening up for me.  It's also always great to
                    have users and feedback!  Check out the new <a href="/cstools">redesign</a>.<br><br>
                    The final piece of big news is that I purchased a domain name.  Welcome to <strong>kershner.org</strong>!  I feel a
                    little more like an actual web developer.<br><br>
                    I'm working on plenty of stuff over here so the next update will also be a big one, until next time!

				<h2>Setbacks</h2>
                <bd>July 13th, 2014</bd>
                <hr>
				<p>
                    I had originally imagined this project taking a something like 2-3 weeks.  As it draws nearer the two-month mark
                    I have to keep reminding myself that this is probably normal for many projects, let alone ones
                    attempted in someone's free time while they are still learning the tools.<br><br>
                    In any case, I've had a few setbacks related to components.  As I rely on Amazon for these
                    components any time I need to order a new one I'm at the mercy of their shipping speed - which
                    is quite fast but still pushes back my progress several days.  In this case I've experienced a
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=raspberry+pi+red+light+no+boot+site:www.raspberrypi.org&es_sm=93">common</a>
                    problem where the Pi's SD card gets slightly warped for whatever reason (likely mishandling by me), making contact with the Pi's
                    SD card reader spotty.  As the RPi has no onboard BIOS, all of the boot code is located on the
                    SD card meaning no contact...no boot.  As I wait for a new card from Amazon I'm working on the
                    other hardware component - the frame!<br><br>
                    I decided to go with the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00078051/">IKEA frame</a>
                    I had mentioned before.

               <p>
                   The frame is simple, sturdy, and will be very easy to paint/otherwise customize.<br><br>
                   Mounting both the display and the Pi itself was extremely simple thanks to the miraculous

               <p>I drilled a hole through the cardboard back-mat to snake the display's power cord through.  I'm pretty
               happy with the result so far - very clean and functional.  It'll look even better once Kerry and I
               decide on an aesthetic and paint the frame.</p>

				<h2>Slow and Steady</h2>
                <bd>July 7th, 2014</bd>
                <hr>
				<p>
                    <b>Work continues steadily on my GIF display</b>.  I'm gradually learning that when it comes to
                    software development side projects it might not always be wise to set a deadline or ETA before starting.
                    Even though life continually gets in the way I've still managed to get some work done on
                    the project.<br><br>
                    First, and most importantly, I think I'm <em>finally</em> somewhat happy with my reddit scraping
                    code.  You can check out the completed bit on my <a href="https://github.com/kershner/blog/blob/master/app/scripts/scrape_reddit.py">Github</a>.
                    The important modifications are mostly in the logic flow of the loop through the subreddit's
                    submissions, but there's also my discovery of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.endswith">endswith()</a>
                    function, which makes checking for a .gif file much cleaner.  I also added an <b>if __name__ == '__main__'</b>
                    clause to make running the script easier between my work and home PCs.  It works pretty well, and I
                    also made similar modifications to my URL clean-up script, located <a href="https://github.com/kershner/blog/blob/master/app/scripts/clean_up_urls.py">here</a>.<br><br>
                    I also added a small bit of code on my server to ensure that the same GIF doesn't play twice until all
                    the GIFs from my urls.txt file have played.<br><br>
                    The basic idea is to now maintain two lists of URLs.  One is the master file that contains all my
                    scraped URLs (and gets added to when I run the scraper), and another that serves as the current
                    'playlist' of GIFs, removing the URL that has just played each time.
                </p>
<pre><code data-language="python">path = '/home/tylerkershner/app/templates/pi_display'

urls_file = open('%s/urls.txt' % path, 'r')
urls_list = list(urls_file)
urls_file.close()

urls_toplay_file = open('%s/urls_to_play.txt' % path, 'r')

                <p>
                    As you can see 'removing' a line from a text file isn't really a concept within programming.  Instead
                    I needed to loop through my stored urls.txt file, add every URL found to a new file (urls_to_play.txt)
                    <b>unless</b> we come across the currently selected URL, in which case it is skipped leaving us with
                    a new file that is identical except for the URL that just played.  If the list of urls_to_play is
                    empty, a new one is generated using the URLs master list and the process starts over.  A little
                    simplistic, but it works just fine!<br><br>
                    Kerry and I have been scoping out some frames in some thrift stores, but so far we haven't found
                    many to be ideal for this project.  I'll probably go with an Ikea frame I saw that I'm quite sure
                    would work, so hopefully we'll get underway this week!
